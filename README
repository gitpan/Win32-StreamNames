Win32-StreamNames version 1.04
==============================


Win32::StreamNames - Perl extension for reading Windows ADS names

SYNOPSIS

    use Win32::StreamNames;
    @streams = StreamNames( $file );
    
    if (@streams)
    {
       ...
    }
    else
    {
       # No Additional Data Stream names
       ...
    }

DESCRIPTION

Additional Data Streams (ADS) were introduced in Windows 2000 with
NTFS 5 (data streams have always been a feature of Windows).
With ADS, a simple file can be extended to include other 
information, and Windows Explorer does just that with its
Summary Information (from the file Properties dialog).

To get at the stream names associated with a file requires a call
to the BackupRead Win32 API, This module provides a simple wrapper
to the API calls.

The only externl function, StreamNames, takes a file or directory 
name as an argument, and returns a list of stream names.  These may
be appended to the original filename to get a fully qualified name,
which may be opened using the usual Perl functions.  

If the specified file or directory cannot be opened then $^E is set   
and an empty list is returned.  Note that an empty list is not
necessarily an error, since a file need not have any additional
streams.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   nmake
   nmake test
   nmake install

   If using the GNU toolset (for example with Strawberry Perl), 
   use dmake instead of nmake.

DEPENDENCIES

This module will only run on Microsoft Windows, and requires a C compiler, a
linker, and a 'make' utility (usually nmake.exe) for installation.

The tests will only run on NTFS5 (available with Windows 2000) or later.

The tests use Win32API::File to check the file system type, which is
bundled with the ActiveState Perl implementation.
